# Planning Directory Overview

This directory serves as the central hub for planning documents related to the project-scaffolding ecosystem. It houses proposals, designs, and strategic plans for evolving the ecosystem, improving its functionality, and ensuring its long-term maintainability.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to:

*   **Centralize Planning:** Provide a single location for all planning-related documents.
*   **Facilitate Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration and discussion around proposed changes and improvements.
*   **Document Decisions:** Record the rationale behind key decisions and architectural choices.
*   **Guide Development:** Provide clear direction for developers working on the project-scaffolding ecosystem.

## Structure

The directory is organized to reflect different levels of planning, from high-level ecosystem initiatives to sub-project specific plans.

*   **Root Level:** Contains documents related to overarching ecosystem-wide initiatives and strategic planning.
*   **Sub-Directories:** May contain planning documents specific to individual sub-projects or components within the ecosystem.

## 🚀 Current Initiatives

These are the active, high-level planning efforts currently underway:

*   [KNOWLEDGE_CYCLE_DISCUSSION](KNOWLEDGE_CYCLE_DISCUSSION.md) - Designing the global feedback loop between projects and scaffolding to ensure continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
*   [GLOBAL_RULES_INJECTION_DESIGN](GLOBAL_RULES_INJECTION_DESIGN.md) - Architecture for automated rule propagation across the ecosystem, ensuring consistency and adherence to standards.
*   [SCAFFOLDING_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN](SCAFFOLDING_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md) - Strategic plan for reducing metadata overhead, improving performance, and simplifying the user experience.

## 🔧 Sub-Project Planning

This section contains planning documents for specific sub-projects or components:

*   **Pre-Commit Hooks**: [PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_PROMPTS_INDEX](pre_commit_hook/PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_PROMPTS_INDEX.md) - Development of automated safety gates to enforce code quality and prevent common errors.
*   **Ollama MCP Enhancement**: [OLLAMA_MCP_RETRY_ESCALATION_SPEC](ollama_mcp_enhancement/OLLAMA_MCP_RETRY_ESCALATION_SPEC.md) - Improving the reliability of local AI integrations through enhanced retry and escalation mechanisms.
