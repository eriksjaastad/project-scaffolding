# Review History Archive

Code reviews are automatically archived here by `scripts/archive_reviews.py`.

## Purpose
Institutional memory. Analyzing past reviews reveals patterns:
- Which mistakes repeat across projects
- Which standards violations are most common
- How review quality changes over time

## Retention Policy
- **Keep indefinitely:** All reviews are kept for "Black Box Thinking" analysis
- **Location:** Reviews filed by project in subdirectories
- **Format:** Markdown files matching `CODE_REVIEW_*.md` or `*review*.md`

## Related Patterns
- See `patterns/code-review-standard.md` for review format standards
- See `docs/CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` for what reviews check
