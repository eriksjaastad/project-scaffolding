# Project Philosophy

## What We're Actually Doing

We don't build **products** (customers, revenue, market fit).  
We build **experiments** (data collection, pattern recognition, learning).

Projects exist because they're **interesting**, not because they're profitable. The goal is to explore, discover, and understand — not to monetize.

---

## The Two-Level Game

Every project operates at two levels simultaneously:

1. **Domain-level patterns** — What can we learn about *this* specific thing?  
   (trading signals, image workflows, news sentiment, etc.)

2. **Meta-level patterns** — What can we learn about *building projects*?  
   (documentation structures, safety systems, testing approaches, deployment patterns)

The domain patterns are specific to each project.  
The meta patterns compound across all projects.

**The real product is the scaffolding.**

## Current Expeditions

### 1. Image-Workflow (2.5 months, battle-tested)
**Domain:** File management, image processing, metadata handling  
**Meta lessons:**
- "Every safety system was a scar" — build protections after you learn what breaks
- Documentation structure (`Documents/` with archives, guides, reference)
- Battle-tested patterns: FileTracker, disaster recovery, session summaries

**Status:** Proven, waiting for work

---

### 2. Trading Co-Pilot (3 weeks, Layer 1-3 complete)
**Domain:** Volatility regimes, AI model comparison, market prediction  
**Meta lessons:**
- Railway + Postgres deployment (reliable scheduling)
- Cron dispatcher pattern (one schedule, multiple jobs)
- Fuzzy grading systems (measuring things that aren't binary)

**Status:** Collecting data (30-60 days before evaluation)

---

### 3. Cortana Personal AI (Layer 1 complete)
**Domain:** Personal memory, voice analysis, pattern detection  
**Meta lessons:**
- Privacy-first architecture (local data, API-only processing)
- Daily automation via launchd (macOS native scheduling)
- Layer-by-layer development (each layer independently useful)
- Cost-conscious AI usage (~$0.60/month with gpt-4o-mini)

**Status:** Foundation complete, Layer 2 in planning

---

### 4. Hypocrisy Now (ongoing)
**Domain:** RSS ingestion, news sentiment, political analysis  
**Meta lessons:**
- RSS infrastructure patterns
- Sentiment analysis approaches
- Content aggregation at scale

**Status:** Active

## The Scaffolding Vision

> "After we do a couple projects that are deep like that one, I would really like to come up with kind of a structure or something like... a thing that all projects would be better off starting with."

We're getting there. After 3-4 deep projects, the patterns will be undeniable.

The scaffolding will include:
- **Documentation structure** (so projects stay maintainable)
- **Safety systems** (so data doesn't get lost)
- **Testing philosophy** (what needs tests vs. what doesn't)
- **Deployment patterns** (Railway, .env, cron, databases)
- **AI collaboration** (CLAUDE.md, clear instructions)
- **Decision frameworks** (when to build, when to kill, when to consolidate)

**Not yet.** We're still in the discovery phase. This document will grow organically as patterns emerge.

## Core Principles (Emerging)

### On Building
- Build because it's **interesting**, not because it's profitable
- Let projects be **experiments** — data tells you what works
- **30-60 days minimum** before judging results (especially with data collection)
- Don't confuse "fun to build" with "needs to scale" (both are valid, but different)

### On Maintenance
- **Consolidate on the 3rd duplicate** — first two teach you the pattern
- **Tests are for fragile parts** — parsing, grading, data integrity
- **Documentation goes stale** — archive aggressively (12 months for sessions, 3 months for misc)
- **Safety systems are scars** — you learn what needs protection by breaking it first

### On Exploration
- **We're explorers, not founders** — the journey is the point
- **Patterns at two levels** — domain + meta
- **The grind is where you learn** — projects born from necessity are the best teachers
- **Show the full picture** — AI collaborators (and humans) connect better with context

### On Data
- **Collect before deciding** — gut instincts need validation
- **Let the data change your mind** — be willing to kill features after testing
- **Measure what matters** — not just "did it run?" but "did it help?"

## What This Isn't

This is **not**:
- A rigid framework (it's fuzzy on purpose)
- A business plan (we're not monetizing)
- A product roadmap (we're exploring, not shipping)
- Complete (it grows as we learn)

---

## What Happens Next

1. **Let Trading Co-Pilot run 30 days** — collect data, see what models/patterns work
2. **Complete Cortana Layer 2** — query interface and pattern detection
3. **Build 1-2 more deep projects** — more patterns will emerge
4. **Extract the scaffolding** — when you can't ignore the repeating patterns anymore
5. **Create `project-scaffolding/` with templates** — the real product ✅ **STARTED!**

## Growing This Document

Add to this file when you notice:
- A pattern repeating across 2+ projects
- A decision framework you wish you'd had earlier
- A safety system that saved you
- A structure that makes projects easier to maintain

Don't force it. Let it grow organically.
