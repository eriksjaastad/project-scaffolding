Historical documents, brain dumps, and planning notes from the project's evolution.

## What's Here

**Planning Notes:**
- `planning-notes-dec-2025.md` - Original 1353-line TODO (brain dump)
- `OPTION_C_BUILD_PLAN.md` - Full automation build plan
- `SYSTEM_WALKTHROUGH.md` - Detailed system design walkthrough
- `CONTEXT_HANDOFF_2025-12-22_tiered-ai-planning.md` - Billing crisis handoff

**Research:**
- `kiro-antigravity info.md` - Initial Kiro/Antigravity research
- `kiro-antigravity info V2.md` - Detailed technical deep dive
- `more cost saving.md` - DeepSeek + Cline CLI research
- `GEMINI_RESEARCH_PROMPT.md` - Prompt for deeper Kiro research

## Why Archived

**Claude Code's Review (Dec 23, 2025):**
> "You've built **documentation about automation** rather than **automation**."

These docs were useful for planning but became noise once we knew what to build.

**Kept in Active Docs:**
- Current actionable docs (KIRO_DEEP_DIVE.md, DEEPSEEK_SETUP.md)
- Code review results
- Chunked action plans

**Archived:**
- Historical planning
- Research notes (superseded by implementation)
- Brain dumps

**Philosophy:** Delete the theater, keep the tools.
