> **Purpose:** Ideas and strategies to revisit when circumstances change

---

## 📋 Contents

1. **AWS Activate Strategy** (`aws_activate_strategy.md`)
   - **What:** Using $1,000 AWS credits to subsidize AI costs via Bedrock
   - **Why March 2026:** Want real business (not "fake"), focused on speed/simplicity now
   - **Revisit When:** Q2 2026 or when first client secured
   - **Open Questions:**
     - Does Bedrock pricing match direct Anthropic pricing? (Gemini claimed yes, needs verification)
     - Does Kiro billing actually flow through AWS account? (Needs testing)

2. **AWS Business Setup** (`aws_business_setup.md`)
   - **What:** Tactical guide to qualifying for AWS Activate Founders ($1k credits)
   - **Why March 2026:** Same as above
   - **Note:** Contains good info on Bedrock API integration (boto3 examples)

## 🎯 When to Revisit

**Triggers:**
- ✅ Secured first paying client for AI automation business
- ✅ Monthly revenue > $1,000 (business is "real")
- ✅ Have legitimate landing page + business structure
- ✅ Ready to apply for AWS Activate Founders (or Portfolio if funded)

**Actions Then:**
1. Build real landing page for AI automation business
2. Apply for AWS Activate ($1k Founders or $100k Portfolio)
3. Test if Kiro billing flows through AWS (to use credits)
4. Verify Bedrock pricing vs direct APIs
5. Consider switching Tier 1 to Bedrock (if credits approved)

## 💡 Current Strategy (December 2025)

**Tier 1 (Architecture):** Kiro CLI @ $19/mo (Claude Sonnet 4/4.5)  
**Tier 2/3 (Features/Boilerplate):** DeepSeek @ $0.27/1M tokens  
**IDE:** Cursor @ $200/mo (primary workflow)  
**Total:** ~$230-250/mo (vs. previous $425/mo = 42% savings)

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Simple (no AWS complexity)
- ✅ Fast (proven to work)
- ✅ Cost-effective (91% savings on Tier 2/3)
- ✅ No ethics concerns (not gaming free credits)
