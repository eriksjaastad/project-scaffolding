# Cursor Rules - Project Scaffolding (Meta-Project)

## What This Project Is

This is the **meta-project** - extracting patterns from experiments to build better projects faster.

**NOT a product.** This is a living collection of:
- Patterns that repeat across projects
- Safety systems that saved us (scars → protections)
- Structures that make maintenance easier
- Decision frameworks we wish we'd had earlier

---

## Philosophy

**Core Reference:** `/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/Trading Projects/PROJECT_PHILOSOPHY.md`

**Summary:**
- We're explorers building experiments, not products
- Data before decisions (30-60 days minimum)
- Two-level game: Domain patterns + **Meta patterns (THIS PROJECT)**
- The scaffolding is the real product

---

## Source Projects

This project learns from:

1. **image-workflow** - 2.5 months, battle-tested
   - Documentation structure (`Documents/` pattern)
   - Safety systems ("every safety system was a scar")
   - Disaster recovery, session archives

2. **Trading Co-Pilot** - 3 weeks, Layer 1-3 complete
   - Railway + Postgres deployment
   - Cron dispatcher pattern
   - Fuzzy grading, multi-model comparison

3. **Cortana Personal AI** - Layer 1 complete
   - Privacy-first architecture (local data, API-only for processing)
   - Daily automation via launchd
   - Layer-by-layer development (incrementally useful)
   - Structured memory storage (JSON + Markdown)
   - Cost-conscious AI usage (~$0.60/month)

4. **Hypocrisy Now** - RSS infrastructure, sentiment analysis
5. **AI Journal** - Documentation patterns

## Working on This Project

### When to Add a Pattern
- **After 2-3 instances** across projects (not just 1)
- **When you wish you'd had it earlier** in a new project
- **After a "scar"** (something broke, now you protect against it)
- **When maintenance gets easier** due to a structure

### What NOT to Do
- Don't create patterns before they prove themselves
- Don't force rigid frameworks (keep it fuzzy)
- Don't extract too early (let patterns emerge naturally)
- Don't make this a product (it's a tool for explorers)

### Structure
```
patterns/          ← Documented patterns (empty until proven)
templates/         ← Reusable starting points
examples/          ← Real examples from projects
docs/              ← Meta-documentation
```

---

## Current Status

**Phase:** Discovery & Pattern Collection (Month 1-2)

**Next phases:**
- Month 3: Consolidate patterns into categories
- Month 4: Extract templates from proven patterns
- Month 6: Consider creating actual `project-scaffolding-template` repo

---

## External Resources Tracking

When adding ANY external service (API, cloud platform, database, etc):

**MUST update:** `/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/project-scaffolding/EXTERNAL_RESOURCES.yaml`

**Standard:**
- Use YAML for all structured data (SSOT pattern).
- Document service name, project, cost, and purpose.
- Never share API keys across projects.
