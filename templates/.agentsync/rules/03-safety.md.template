# Safety Rules

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE RULE: Trash, Don't Delete
**NEVER use these commands:**
- `rm` (any form: rm, rm -f, rm -r, rm -rf)
- `unlink`
- `shred`
- `find -delete`
- Any Python/Perl/Ruby file deletion

**ALWAYS use these instead:**
- `trash <file>` - CLI trash command
- `send2trash` - Python library
- `git restore <file>` - For tracked files you want to revert

**Why:** Permanent deletion cannot be recovered. Trash can be recovered.
**If trash command is not available:** STOP and ask the user. Do not find workarounds.

## File Operations
- Use `trash` CLI (preferred) or `send2trash` (Python)
- Use `git restore` for reverting tracked files

## Context Protocol

If context is missing or a file is unknown:
- **STOP** and request information from the Floor Manager
- **DO NOT GUESS**

## Failure Protocol

If Worker fails **3 times** on the same task:
- Halt and alert the Conductor
- Do not continue attempting
