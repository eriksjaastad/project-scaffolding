=============================================================================
GUIDANCE FOR AI SESSIONS:
=============================================================================

This TODO is designed to be both HUMAN and AI readable.

When updating this file:
1. Always update "Last Updated" date at the top
2. Move completed tasks from Pending → Completed (keep the checkbox [x])
3. Add dates to completed phases
4. Update "Current State" section as project evolves
5. Keep Blockers section honest and current
6. Mark tasks as [x] when done, don't delete them (shows progress)
7. Update Success Criteria as understanding improves
8. Keep Notes section current (costs, time, related projects)

When reading this file at session start:
1. Read "Current State" first (understand where things are)
2. Check "Blockers & Dependencies" (know what's stopping progress)
3. Review "Pending Tasks" (understand what's next)
4. Check "Success Criteria" (know what "done" looks like)
5. Scan "Notes" for context (costs, related projects, decisions)

Priority Emojis:
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Must do first, blocking other work
- 🟡 HIGH: Important but not blocking
- 🔵 MEDIUM: Nice to have, can wait
- 🟢 LOW: Backlog, future consideration

Task Status:
- [ ] Not started
- [x] Completed (never delete, shows progress!)

Formatting:
- Use clear hierarchy (Phase → Task Group → Task → Sub-task)
- Keep task descriptions actionable ("Create X", not "X needs creating")
- Include enough context for a new AI session to understand

Meta-Philosophy:
- This is a living document
- Honest assessment > optimistic projection
- Show progress (keep completed tasks)
- Context for future you/AI (notes, decisions, questions)

=============================================================================
