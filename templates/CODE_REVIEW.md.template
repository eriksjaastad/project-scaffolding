# Code Review Checklist - Project Scaffolding

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewer:** [Name/Model]
**Pre-Review Scan:** ✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED

---

## TIER 1: PROPAGATION SOURCES (Must Check First)

### Templates (Highest Blast Radius)
- [ ] `templates/.cursorrules.template` - No hardcoded paths
- [ ] `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` - No hardcoded paths
- [ ] `templates/AGENTS.md.template` - No hardcoded paths
- [ ] `templates/TODO.md.template` - No hardcoded paths
- [ ] `templates/*.template` - All other templates checked

### Root Configs (Referenced by Projects)
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` - No hardcoded paths, accurate constraints
- [ ] `.cursorrules` - No hardcoded paths
- [ ] `.cursorignore` - Appropriate exclusions

### Data Files (Used by Scripts)
- [ ] `EXTERNAL_RESOURCES.yaml` - No hardcoded paths
- [ ] Schema validation script works
- [ ] Data structure is sound

**Tier 1 Grade:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
**If FAIL, stop here and fix before continuing**

---

## TIER 2: EXECUTION CRITICAL

### Scripts (scripts/)
- [ ] All functions have type hints
- [ ] No `except: pass` or silent failures
- [ ] Error handling returns status codes
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (verified by scan)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (verified by scan)

### Modules (scaffold/)
- [ ] Same standards as scripts
- [ ] Async error handling correct (if applicable)
- [ ] Retry logic present for external calls

### Governance
- [ ] `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is executable
- [ ] Test suite covers expected scope
- [ ] Tests actually pass (not just claimed)

**Tier 2 Grade:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

---

## TIER 3: DOCUMENTATION

### Core Docs
- [ ] README.md is accurate
- [ ] Standards docs are current
- [ ] Pattern docs have scar stories

### Consistency
- [ ] Docs don't contradict code
- [ ] Examples are runnable
- [ ] Links aren't broken

**Tier 3 Grade:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

---

## INVERSE TEST ANALYSIS

For each passing test, document what it DOESN'T check:

**Test:** `test_no_hardcoded_paths()`
- **Checks:** `scripts/` only
- **Doesn't Check:** `templates/`, configs, YAML files
- **Action Taken:** [Manual verification / Expanded test / Accepted risk]

**Test:** `test_scripts_have_type_hints()`
- **Checks:** `scripts/` only
- **Doesn't Check:** `scaffold/` modules
- **Action Taken:** [...]

---

## META-REVIEW

- [ ] Checked ALL files in templates/
- [ ] Verified test scope matches claims
- [ ] Scanned for deprecated APIs
- [ ] Verified dependency safety
- [ ] Checked exception handling
- [ ] No assumptions without verification

---

## FINAL GRADE & BLOCKERS

**Overall Grade:** [A+ / A / A- / B / C / D / F]

**Ship Blockers (Must Fix):**
1. [Issue and location]

**Recommended Fixes (Nice to Have):**
1. [Issue and location]

**Confidence Level:** [High / Medium / Low]
- High = Checked everything systematically
- Medium = Some assumptions made
- Low = Possible blind spots remain

**Ready to Propagate:** ✅ YES / ❌ NO
